The client has reached a couch, the therapist\'s facial expression is almost non-existent and the therapy is overcome by "Let\'s go back to your childhood." Actually, this is not really what happened during therapy. Therapy is a process of discovery that allows you to realize your feelings, thoughts, beliefs about yourself and others, your attitudes and unconscious driving forces that you do not even realize in daily life, accompanied by mental health professionals who have completed their necessary training. The most important purpose of this discovery process is to gain insight into the challenges you are experiencing, to bring about changes in your thoughts and feelings, to identify the motivation you need to implement these changes and the appropriate ways for change. We all want someone to listen to us and understand. This is one of the reasons we came to therapy. Today, interest in therapy has increased, but some of us still have the idea that "I do it with my mother / father / wife, etc.". Our troubles with our relatives and friends are really troubles and the focus is on troubles. In the therapy process with the therapist, the focus is on change.

     The word motivation comes from the Latin word movere, that is, the movement.

     The motives of physiological origin such as hunger, thirst are called impulse. 
     High impulses such as people\'s desire to be succeed is called the need. 
     In understanding the motivation process, the relationships and meanings between needs and impulses are important. 
     The limit of what people will be able to is determined by their level of education and skill, 
     and the limit of what people can do is determined by the level of morale and motivation.
